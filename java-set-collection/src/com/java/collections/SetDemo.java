/*
 * Set Interface in Java is present in java.util package. 
 * It extends the Collection interface. 
 * It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store the duplicate items. 
 * We can store at most one null value in Set. 
 * Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

Set can be instantiated as:

Set<data-type> s1 = new HashSet<data-type>();  
Set<data-type> s2 = new LinkedHashSet<data-type>();  
Set<data-type> s3 = new TreeSet<data-type>();
