		 * A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair.
		 *  Each key and value pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.

A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.
There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap, 
and three classes: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.
		 
		Map<--- HashMap, LinkedHashMap
		SortedMap<--TreeMap.
		
		
		A Map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values. 
		HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.
		
		*HashMap is the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order.
		*LinkedHashMap is the implementation of Map. It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.
		*TreeMap is the implementation of Map and SortedMap. It maintains ascending order.
